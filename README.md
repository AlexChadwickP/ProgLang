# ProgLang
The name is just temporary. It's just some weird programming language I've been working on because I'm incredibly bored
during the weekends. It is incredibly badly written probably since I'm terrible at Rust, and it has some inspiration
from the Forth programming language?

## Features
### Addition!
```
[INT] [INT] +
```

Example:
```java
> 12 13 + // Outputs 25
```

### Printing!
```
[STRING] puts
```

Example:
```java
> "Hello, world!" puts // Output: "Hello, world!"
```
